# Udacity-Project2----Wrangle-and-Analyze-Data

#Introduction
Using Python and its libraries, I will gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. 

The dataset that I will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as **WeRateDogs**. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog.

## Process
* Step 1: Gathering data

* Step 2: Assessing data

* Step 3: Cleaning data

* Step 4: Storing data

* Step 5: Analyzing, and visualizing data

* Step 6: Reporting <br>
I will create a word written report called wrangle_report.pdf or wrangle_report.html that briefly describes your wrangling efforts. T

I will also create a 250-word-minimum written report called act_report.pdf to communicate all the insights and displays the visualization(s) produced from your wrangled data.
